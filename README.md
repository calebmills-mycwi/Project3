  We only had to change a couple lines of code to get the result we were looking for. When you emulate this on an android device each list item now displays the word "Flagged".
  It is grabbing this from the back-end and displaying it on the front-end.
  Made several comments in the files:
	baseNote.js
	noteListView.js
	noteListItem.html

  Those are also the only files we made changes in.
